### 3. Update Documentation

Once packages are approved:

1. Update README.md with confirmed installation methods
2. Add package manager badges
3. Update installation scripts with verified package names
4. Create announcement blog post or release notes

### 4. Metrics and Analytics

Track success metrics:

- Download counts per package manager
- Installation success rates
- User feedback and issues
- Geographic distribution
- Version adoption rates

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Checksum Mismatches

- Regenerate packages after any binary changes
- Verify download URLs are correct
- Check that GitHub release assets are public

### License Issues

- Ensure dual MIT/Apache-2.0 licensing is clearly documented
- Include LICENSE files in all packages
- Update package metadata if required

### Security Scans

- Some package managers run security scans
- Address any flagged dependencies
- Provide security contact information

### Build Failures

- Test on clean systems matching package manager requirements
- Update minimum system requirements if needed
- Provide alternative installation methods

## Emergency Procedures

### Package Recall

If a critical issue is discovered:

1. Contact package maintainers immediately
2. Update GitHub releases to mark as pre-release
3. Submit patches through fast-track processes
4. Communicate with users through all available channels

### Version Updates

For future releases:

1. Update version in all package definitions
2. Run full test suite
3. Submit updates in same order as initial submission
4. Monitor for any breaking changes or new requirements

## Success Criteria
