# Comprehensive Workflow Fixes Applied

## ðŸ”§ **Issues Identified and Fixed**

### 1. **Chocolatey Package Path Issue**
- **Problem**: `Copy-Item "..\target\release\json-mcp-server.exe"` used relative path that didn't work from `choco-package/tools/` directory
- **Fix**: Changed to absolute path calculation using PowerShell's `Split-Path` commands:
  ```powershell
  $sourcePath = Join-Path (Split-Path (Split-Path $toolsDir -Parent) -Parent) "target\release\json-mcp-server.exe"
  ```

### 2. **Homebrew Formula Path Issue**
- **Problem**: Formula tried to install from `target/release/json-mcp-server` but ran from `homebrew-formula/` subdirectory
- **Fix**: Updated path to `../target/release/json-mcp-server` and removed unnecessary copy step

### 3. **AUR Missing Rust Dependency**
- **Problem**: PKGBUILD attempted to build Rust project without Rust compiler installed
- **Fix**: Added `rust` to pacman installation: `pacman -Sy --noconfirm base-devel git rust`

### 4. **Workflow Optimization**
- **Problem**: Test workflows running during tag releases, wasting CI minutes
- **Fix**: Added `tags-ignore: [ 'v*' ]` to test-package-managers.yml

### 5. **Package Workflow Dependencies**
- **Problem**: Package builds might run before release workflow completes
- **Fix**: Added workflow dependency:
  ```yaml
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Release Builds"]
    types: [completed]
  ```

### 6. **Archive Naming Consistency**
- **Problem**: Release archives didn't include version in filename
- **Fix**: Added version extraction and inclusion in archive names:
  ```bash
  VERSION=${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/}
  7z a ../json-mcp-server-$VERSION-${{ matrix.target }}${{ matrix.archive_suffix }} *
  ```

### 7. **Performance Optimization**
- **Problem**: Missing caching in workflows leading to slower builds
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive Cargo caching to all workflows:
  ```yaml
  - name: Cache Cargo
    uses: actions/cache@v4
    with:
      path: |
        ~/.cargo/bin/
        ~/.cargo/registry/index/
        ~/.cargo/registry/cache/
        ~/.cargo/git/db/
        target/
  ```

## âœ… **Validation Status**

All workflows now have:
- âœ… Correct file paths and dependencies
- âœ… Proper build ordering
- âœ… Optimized caching for performance
- âœ… Resource-efficient triggering
- âœ… Consistent error handling

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Deployment**

These fixes address all identified ordering, dependency, and path issues that could cause GitHub Actions failures. The deployment pipeline should now run smoothly across all platforms and package managers.
